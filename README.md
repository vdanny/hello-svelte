# hello-svelte

This is a boilerplate for svelte with SSR feature.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit vdanny/hello-svelte [your-app-name]
cd [your-app-name]
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd [your-app-name]
npm install
```

...then start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
